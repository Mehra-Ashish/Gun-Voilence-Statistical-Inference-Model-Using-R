Gun violence is one of the major issues ongoing in The United States. After each mass shooting, countless debates over the issue of gun control start to come up the surface and end without any significance changes in laws designed to combat the problem of gun control. One of the ways in which The United States government is trying to combat the issue of gun violence is by introducing the ‘Shall – Issue’ law. A Shall-issue law is one that requires that governments issue concealed carry handgun permits to any applicant who meets the necessary criteria. The criteria are as follows: • The applicant must be an adult. • The applicant must not have a significant criminal record. • The applicant must not have any history of mental illness. • If required by law, the applicant must complete a course in firearms safety training. If the above requirements are met, the granting authority has no discretion in the awarding of the licenses, and there is no requirement of the applicant to demonstrate "good cause". The problem we are trying to solve is to determine if the shall issue laws have any sort of affect in reducing the incidents of violent crimes. Our approach to solve this problem by analyzing historical data on crime in The United States
